I invoked the method named "handleRequest" where I've encapsulated all the functionalities for querying URLs. This method requires the website's URL as a parameter, with pertinent details including the path of the website, the key for querying, and the messages to be queried. 

To display new messages on the site, I need to modify the URL data, appending "/add-message?s=" to its tail. Within the code, I have already established an ArrayList designed to accumulate all the messages. Consequently, each time a message is appended through the query request "/add-message?s=", it gets preserved in the ArrayList.

First I use /add-message?s=Hello,Hello become first message in Webpage.

Second I use /add-message?s=How are you,How are you become second message in Webpage.

During weeks 2 and 3, my educational journey was significantly enriched as I acquired a multitude of new skills and insights. Among these, I mastered the technique of securely logging into a remote server via SSH, a process that not only enhanced my system administration capabilities but also deepened my comprehension of network security. 

In essence, these novel learning experiences have not only embellished my skill set but have also kindled a fervent passion for deeper exploration within the IT realm.
